# Authentication Structure Restructuring

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to consolidate and improve the authentication file structure in the ClassTeamUp project.

## Previous Structure Issues
The project had two separate authentication directory structures:
- `src/app/(auth)/auth/` - Basic signin and signup pages
- `src/app/auth/` - Specialized auth pages (instructor-signin, student-signin, forgot-password, etc.)

This dual structure created confusion and inconsistency in the codebase.

## New Structure
All authentication pages are now consolidated under `src/app/(auth)/`:

```
src/app/(auth)/
├── callback/
├── forgot-password/
├── instructor-signin/
├── signin/
├── signup/
├── student-signin/
└── update-password/
```

## Changes Made
1. Created new directories under `src/app/(auth)/` for all auth pages
2. Moved files from `src/app/auth/` to corresponding directories in `src/app/(auth)/`
3. Updated all import and route references to use the new paths:
   - `/auth/signin` → `/signin`
   - `/auth/signup` → `/signup`
   - `/auth/forgot-password` → `/forgot-password`
   - etc.
4. Updated the reset-password API endpoint to redirect to the correct path

## Benefits
- Cleaner, more consistent file structure
- Better adherence to Next.js routing conventions
- Improved developer experience with logical organization
- Simplified URL paths for users

## Next Steps
1. Test all authentication flows to ensure they work correctly with the new structure
2. Once confirmed working, remove the redundant directories:
   - `src/app/(auth)/auth/`
   - `src/app/auth/`

## Note
The route group `(auth)` in Next.js doesn't affect the URL path but helps with organization and shared layouts. All auth pages will be accessible via `/signin`, `/signup`, etc. rather than `/auth/signin`.
